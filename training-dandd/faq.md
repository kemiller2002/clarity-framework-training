# Clarity Lab — Teen Stress Test Q&A

## 1. “Isn’t this just common sense?”

**Response:**

> “Yeah. It *is* common sense.  
> The problem is common sense disappears under pressure.  
> This just gives you a way to grab it back.”

Optional follow-up:

> “Most strategy errors aren’t intelligence problems.  
> They’re clarity problems.”

## 2. “In real life you can’t roll dice.”

**Response:**

> “Right. In real life you don’t see the dice.  
> The randomness is still there — you just don’t get to watch it roll.”

Follow-up:

> “In D&D the dice make uncertainty visible.  
> In real life uncertainty is hidden.  
> But it’s still there.”

Optional line:

> “The dice are just the physics engine.”

## 3. “Sometimes chaos is fun. Why reduce it?”

**Response:**

> “You’re right. Chaos is fun — when you choose it.  
> This isn’t about removing chaos.  
> It’s about controlling when you allow it.”

Follow-up:

> “This isn’t a ‘use this for every decision’ tool.  
> It’s a ‘use this when it matters’ tool.”

Or:

> “This is the ‘okay, now we’re serious’ switch.”

## 4. “How do we know when it’s one of those moments?”

**Response:**

> “You don’t always know.  
> That’s the point.”

Then:

> “You know it’s one of those moments when the cost of being wrong is high.”

Examples:
- Burning your last resource  
- Splitting the party  
- Locking into something irreversible

## 5. “If we’re going to be wrong sometimes anyway, why bother?”

**Response:**

> “This doesn’t make you right.  
> It makes you recover faster when you’re wrong.”

Follow-up:

> “Bad decisions aren’t what wipe groups.  
> Slow realization does.”

Or:

> “The goal isn’t perfection.  
> It’s avoiding compounding mistakes.”

---

## 6. “So this is basically damage control?”

**Response:**

> “Yes. It’s damage control.  
> But smart damage control beats pretending you won’t take damage.”

Or:

> “Every strategy game is damage control.  
> You’re managing risk, not eliminating it.”

Sharper version:

> “If you think strategy isn’t damage control, you’re playing on easy mode.”
