All pages share:
- The same navigation
- The same footer
- The same language discipline

## Terminology (Locked)

The following terms are intentionally consistent across the site:

- **Clarity Framework** — the diagnostic framework
- **Training** — the offering (not course, program, or workshop)
- **Session** — a unit of training work
- **Decision** — the object of diagnosis
- **Request an Invite** — the sole primary call to action

Avoid introducing synonyms casually.  
Frameworks lose authority when language drifts.

## Tone and Language Rules

All copy on this site should adhere to these constraints:

- Calm, adult, non-performative
- No hype verbs (“unlock”, “accelerate”, “transform”)
- No outcome guarantees
- No authority-by-assertion
- No instructional or prescriptive voice

The framework **surfaces** failure modes.  
It does not claim to eliminate them.

---

## Boundaries Matter

Boundaries are not defensive.  
They are part of the framework itself.

Every page should reinforce—explicitly or implicitly:

- What the framework does **not** do
- What problems it cannot solve
- When it is inappropriate to use

If a page can be screenshot out of context and read as a promise, it needs revision.

---

## Calls to Action

There is **one** primary action on the entire site:

> **Request an Invite**

All other links and phrases exist only to explain *why* someone might take that action—not to introduce alternatives.

---

## Making Changes

Before adding or changing anything, ask:

1. Does this clarify the framework—or add surface area?
2. Does this strengthen boundaries—or weaken them?
3. Does this increase trust—or demand belief?
4. Would this still make sense if read in isolation?

If the answer is unclear, don’t add it.

---

## What Comes Later (Intentionally Absent)

These are deferred on purpose:

- Pricing
- Schedules
- Testimonials
- Certifications
- Case studies with outcomes
- Metrics or logos

They may be introduced later—but only if they can be done without compromising clarity or boundaries.

---

## Philosophy in One Sentence

> The goal is not to make decisions easy.  
> The goal is to make decision failure visible.

Everything in this repository should support that idea.
